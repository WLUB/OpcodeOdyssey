# Opcode Odyssey

A basic game developed using x86 assembly for MacOS. This project is intended as a learning exercise for understanding assembly language. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following installed to run Opcode Odyssey:

1. NASM: The Netwide Assembler, a portable 80x86 and x86-64 assembler.

2. SDL2: A cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

3. SDL2_image: An SDL2 extension library which provides the loading of images in various formats.

### Installation

1. First, clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Compile the code using the provided Makefile. Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
make all
```
This will generate the object files and the executable `main`.

## How to Play

Run the executable `main` in your terminal:

```bash
./main
```

## Game Controls

The player controls are quite simple and are based on the keyboard keys:

- `A`: Move player to the left.
- `D`: Move player to the right.
- `S`: Move player down.
- `W`: Move player up.
- Throw a ball using the arrow keys

## Code Description

The code is structured in assembly with the following sections:

1. `.data`: This section contains the initialized data such as window variables, player image path, and debug messages.

2. `.bss`: This section includes variables which are not initialized yet. It includes window settings and player variables.

3. `.text`: This is the code section.

## Built With

- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) - The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler designed for portability and modularity.

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) - A cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

- [SDL2_image](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2_image/FrontPage) - An SDL2 extension library which enables the loading of images in various formats.

## Acknowledgments

The System V AMD64 calling convention is used in this game (find more details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI))

## Clean Up

To remove the object and executable files, run:

```bash
make clean
```
This will remove the object files and the executable `main`.

## Future Work

Any suggestions for improvements are welcome.
